Attempt to learn more about how databases work. I really liked my databases class and would like to continue understanding the fundamentals, namely how the data is stored on disk and in memory. I'm gonna go for the sqlite implementation because their design is documented and there's a book I can follow called "SQLite Database System: Design and Implementation" by Sibsankar Haldar.
